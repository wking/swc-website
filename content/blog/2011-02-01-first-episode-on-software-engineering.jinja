<p>I know we promised a lecture on high-performance computing, but today wound up going in a different direction: we have just posted an episode on <a href="/4_0/softeng/ebse.html">empirical results in software engineering</a>, which we hope will set the stage for discussion of how to manage larger teams and projects. We hope you enjoy hearing about some of the science behind the things this course teaches; as always, feedback is welcome.</p>
