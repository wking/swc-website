Title: Python Lecture Coming Online
Tags: content, versions/version-4

<p>Slides for the first few episodes of <a href="/4_0/python/">our lecture on Python</a> are now online; recordings should follow tomorrow and Thursday, and slides for the rest of the lecture should be up by the weekend.  I think the content is OK, but it feels like there's too much shoveling: we're throwing a lot of features at people without showing them how they'll make life better.  I think there's inevitably some of that in an intro like this&mdash;people need to know a few things before any of them can be put to work&mdash;but I'd welcome suggestions on reorganizing the material.</p>
