<p>A few weeks ago we gave a quiz to the SWC students on the first three topics of the course: Version Control, Spreadsheets, and Databases.  We did this in addition to our <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2010/11/summary-of-student-check-ins.html">student check-ins</a> in order to get a sense of how the students were doing with the material.  Half of the class (24 students) submitted their answers.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br />
Everyone did really, really well!  The majority of the mistakes were small SQL syntax errors, or other similarly minor things.</p>
<p><strong>Problem areas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spreadsheets &mdash; Absolute References</em>:<br />
This was probably the most common error made on the quiz.  There were quite a few instances where students failed to recognize the necessity of using absolute references in their solutions.  (Questions 2 and 6 in the Spreadsheets section of the quiz.)</li>
<li><em>Databases &mdash; Nested Queries</em>:<br />
The final question of the quiz involved nested queries.  A few of the students did not use nested queries correctly, or failed to use them at all.</li>
<li><em>Version Control &mdash; Comments</em>:<br />
Ah, of course.  There was tendency for students to skip the "give a meaningful comment" part when explaining how to commit changes to a repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the students did very well.  We did not assign numeric scores, but the majority of the quizzes were perfect or near to it.</p>
<p>Well done, Fall 2010 class!</p>
