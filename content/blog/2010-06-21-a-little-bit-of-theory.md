Title: A Little Bit of Theory
Tags: lectures, versions/version-4

<p>The third episode of our lecture on regular expressions is now <a href="/4_0/regexp/mechanics.html">on the web</a>. This one describes how regular expressions are implemented using finite state machines: it's more theoretical (with a very small 't') than previous episodes, and we'd welcome feedback.</p>
