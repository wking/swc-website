<p>As of this morning, I have signed commitments for 4/5 of the money I need to spend a year working full-time on updating the Software Carpentry course. If you, or someone you know, would like to help me help scientists be more productive, please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">get in touch</a>: I have only 64 days in which to find the $30K I still need.</p>
