Tags: noticed

<p><a href="http://www.floss4science.com/">FLOSS for Science</a>, a site devoted to free/libre/open source software for scientific computing, has just published <a href="http://www.floss4science.com/floss4science-interviews-books/">two volumes of interviews</a> with people in the community. The content doesn't appear to be open, but it's only $9.99 for the pair.</p>
