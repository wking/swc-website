<p>The last four episodes of our <a href="/4_0/python/">lecture on Python</a> are now available, covering:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/4_0/python/lib.html">libraries</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/4_0/python/tuples.html">tuples</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/4_0/python/slice.html">slicing</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="/4_0/python/text.html">what <em>is</em> text</a>, anyway?</li>
</ul>
<p>The last isn't really about Python, but it's something people trip over pretty quickly when they start using it.  Hope you find them useful...</p>
