<p>I will be giving a one-day workshop on software skills for computational economists at the 17th International Conference on Computing in Economics and Finance (<a href="http://www.frbsf.org/economics/conferences/1106/agenda.php">CEF 2011</a>) in San Francisco on Tuesday, June 28. I'm going to talk about version control, tracking provenance, systematic testing, and key results in empirical software engineering; there will also be a guest lecture from <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/">Michael Nielsen</a> about the future of scientific practice in a networked world.</p>
