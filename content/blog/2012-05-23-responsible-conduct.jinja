<p>Titus Brown, Ethan White, and I have been talking about what Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) standards would look like in computational science. Titus has posted a <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/may-12/computational-rcr.html">four-point summary</a>; we would welcome your input over on his blog.</p>
