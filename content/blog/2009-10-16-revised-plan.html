<p>I've posted updates to the <a href="/4_0/">revised course outline</a>. In particular, I have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moved testing earlier.</li>
<li>Clarified intent in a couple of places.</li>
<li>Made an list of things we're leaving out.</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, feedback would be welcome. I'd also be grateful for pointers to places that might fund this work: as I've found in the past, many people think the course is a good idea, but it doesn't quite fit into their funding mandates :-(</p>
