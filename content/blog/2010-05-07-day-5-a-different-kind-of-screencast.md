Title: Day 5: A Different Kind of Screencast
Tags: lectures, versions/version-4

<p>I spent most of today creating another <a href="/4_0/databases/filter.html">screencast</a>, this one explaining what "and", "or", and "not" mean to programmers and how they work. There are no live examples this time: instead, I illustrated the talk with some simple images. Setting aside the question of whether Venn diagrams are the best way to explain Boolean logic, do you prefer this to live desktop of the <a href="/4_0/databases/select.html">previous screencast</a>? Do the jumps back and forth between sets and tables make sense, or are they confusing? Do the colors add value, or should we stick to black &amp; white? And how about the pace&mdash;is it too fast, too slow, too repetitive, et cetera?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback.</p>
