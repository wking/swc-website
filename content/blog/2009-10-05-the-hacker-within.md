Title: The Hacker Within
Tags: community, venues/university-of-wisconsin

<p>I did a web search for "software carpentry" a couple of weeks ago to update my impressions of how the material was being used, and stumbled across <a href="http://hackerwithin.org/">The Hacker Within</a>,a self-help group at the University of Wisconsin for grad students in science who want to improve their computing skills.  I had a great chat with the organizers by phone on Thursday, and hope to get there in the spring to meet them in person.  It's always great to meet the people the course is designed to help; I'd welcome pointers to other groups if you have them.</p>
