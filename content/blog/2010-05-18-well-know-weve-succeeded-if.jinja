<p>We will know the students taking this course have learned something if:</p>
<ol>
<li>They understand why Titus Brown's <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/may-10/data-management.html">Data Management Plan</a> post is both funny and sad.</li>
<li>They have the knowledge, skills, and tools they need to do something about it.</li>
