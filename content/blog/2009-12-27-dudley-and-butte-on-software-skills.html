<p>Via <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog">Titus Brown</a>, a new PLoS paper titled "<a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000589">A Quick Guide for Developing Effective Bioinformatics Programming Skills</a>" by Joel Dudley and Atul Butte. Their recommendations are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming languages</li>
<li>Embracing open source</li>
<li>Unix command-line skills</li>
<li>Keeping projects documented and manageable</li>
<li>Preserving source code with version control</li>
<li>Embracing parallel computing paradigms</li>
<li>Structuring data for speed and scalability</li>
<li>Understanding the capabilities of hardware</li>
<li>Embracing standards and interoperability</li>
<li>Put a high value on your time</li>
</ol>
<p>I think all these things matter, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many hours do the authors think are needed to acquire these skills? We've tried very hard to fit Software Carpentry into 25 hours of lecture and 50-100 hours of practical work because we recognize that every one of those hours is time students <em>aren't</em> spending doing science.</li>
<li>Shouldn't testing be in the top 10? Or the top 5, or 3? These days, I care a lot more about how (and how well) someone tests than I do about their mastery of any particular programming language.</li>
</ol>
