<p>In the latest <a href="http://inscight.org/2012/02/29/episode-25-advanced-school-for-scientific-software-development/">Inscight podcast</a>, the inimitable Katy Huff talks to several of the participants in the boot camp she and Tommy Guy are leading at the <a href="/bootcamps/2012-02-itcp.html">International Centre for Theoretical Physics</a>. It's great to hear so many people from all over the world learning so much.</p>
