<p>On November 11, 2012 I'll be giving a workshop in Washington, D.C. on number crunching with Python. The event is organized by <a href="http://meetup.dcpython.org/">DC Python</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-DC/">Data Science DC</a>, who were kind enough to ask me to teach. The focus of the workshop will be on core scientific Python packages like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, IPython, and, with the help of <a href="http://jseabold.net/">Skipper Seabold</a>, pandas.</p>
<p>The workshop filled up fast but there is a wait list you can join in case people drop out or we find a bigger venue. Details are at <a href="http://meetup.dcpython.org/events/81931062/">http://meetup.dcpython.org/events/81931062/</a>.</p>
