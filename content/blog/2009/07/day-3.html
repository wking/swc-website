<p>Day 3 of the course&mdash;we did <a href="{{root_path}}/3_0/py04.html">sets and dictionaries</a> in the morning (glossing over the handwaving in the notes about computational complexity, since <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fpitt">Francois Pitt</a> is going to cover that properly later), and then <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~pgries">Paul Gries</a> showed students some basic <a href="{{root_path}}/3_0/imgproc.html">image processing</a>. Students found the morning exercise challenging, but seemed to be getting lots out of it. The visit to the pub this evening was still quite welcome, though :-). Tomorrow, <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~reid">Karen Reid</a> is introducing them to the Unix shell; we'll let you know how it goes.</p>
