For more information, or if you are interested in taking part, please see the IASSE's web site.  The dates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>January 16-20: one lecture per day, plus practical, with a quiz on Friday.</li>
<li>January 23-27: ditto.</li>
<li>February 6-10: two lectures and practical per day, with a short final exam on Friday afternoon.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've got a <em>lot</em> to do between now and then...</p>
