Tags: community, sponsors/enthought, versions/version-3

<p>Traffic on the Software Carpentry site was up again in October, after a dip in September:</p>

<p>The sys admin at <a href="http://www.enthought.com">Enthought</a> also cleaned the comment spam out of the Trac they gave me to manage the project.  I have two dozen more minor tickets to file from email I've received in the last few weeks (much of it from Germany).  Still waiting for people to start contributing content &mdash; any volunteers?</p>
