Title: Our First Hackathon
Tags: community

<p>We'd like to invite our friends to a week-long hackathon at Mozilla's office in Toronto in June to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create new teaching material</li>
  <li>give each other feedback on teaching (we'll run a workshop during the week)</li>
  <li>build new tools (like extensions for the IPython Notebook)</li>
  <li>get to know each other</li>
</ul>
<p>We will have a small budget to help with travel and accommodation, but unfortunately most people will have to fund themselves.  On the other hand, Toronto's beautiful that time of year, and there are lots of interesting places a visiting scientist could give a talk.  If you're interested, please stay tuned for dates (which we should have in January).</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
