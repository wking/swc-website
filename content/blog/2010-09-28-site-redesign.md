Title: A New Site Design
Tags: community

<p>We've just made a few changes to the layout and look and feel of the Software Carpentry site.</p>
<ul>
<li>The blog and new content is now accessible directly at <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">http://software-carpentry.org/</a> Version 3.0 of the course material is still available at <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/3_0/index.html">http://software-carpentry.org/3_0</a>.</li>
<li>We've put all of the new content under the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/">Topics</a> menu, and shuffled a few of the other pages around to make things easier to find.</li>
<li>We've updated the WordPress theme to one that works better for embedded screencasts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know in the comments how you like the new configuration, and if you find any glitches.</p>
