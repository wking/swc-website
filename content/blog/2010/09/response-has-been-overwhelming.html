<p>I'm very pleased to announce that the Fall 2010 offering of this course to Ontario graduate students is now full: we'll be sending acceptance notices to applicants tonight and tomorrow. We hope to offer it again starting in January 2011, so if you didn't make it in this time, please check back in December.</p>
