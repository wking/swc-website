<p>I'm not much of a graphic artist (in both my startups, I was told after a few weeks that I was <em>never</em> to work on the user interface again), so I'd appreciate your help designing a flyer/noticeboard poster for Software Carpentry. <a href="{{root_path}}/files/2010/09/online-2010-fall.pdf">This PDF</a> is what I have so far; anything more constructive than, "My eyes! My eyes! Aargh!" would be very welcome.</p>
