<p>In response to Titus Brown's not-really-joking <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/may-10/data-management.html">spoof of how most scientists manage their data</a>, Scimatic's Jim Graham has asked, "<a href="http://www.scimatic.com/node/361">What is reproducibility, anyway?</a>" His main point is that if I re-run your code on your data, and get the same result that you got, I haven't actually added to the sum total of human knowledge. If I get an equivalent answer using <em>different</em> code, on the other hand, then our confidence in the answer is usefully increased. What do you think?</p>
