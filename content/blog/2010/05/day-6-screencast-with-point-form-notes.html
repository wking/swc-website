<p>Jason Montojo and I put together an <a href="/4_0/spreadsheets/intro.html">introductory screencast about spreadsheets</a> today. Unlike our <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2010/05/first-preliminary-alpha-test-etc-screencast.html">previous</a> <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2010/05/day-5-a-different-kind-of-screencast.html">screencasts</a>, this one is accompanied by point-form slide-style notes instead of prose paragraphs. We'd be grateful for your feedback: are notes of this kind useful? Are they comprehensible without watching the screencast itself? If the notes were available in slide format (Keynote, PowerPoint, Impress, or plain old PDF) would they be enough for you to lecture with?</p>
