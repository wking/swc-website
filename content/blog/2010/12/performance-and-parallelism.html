<p>Some topics for a lecture on parallel programming:</p>
<ol>
<li>how to measure/compare performance (raw speed, weak scaling, strong scaling, Amdahl's Law, response time vs. throughput)</li>
<li>the register/cache/RAM/virtual memory/local disk/remote storage hierarchy and the relative performance of each (order of magnitude)</li>
<li>in-processor pipelining (or, why branches reduce performance, and why vectorized operations are a good thing)</li>
<li>how that data-parallel model extends to distributed-memory systems, and what the limits of that model are</li>
<li>the shared-memory (threads and locks) model, its performance<br />
limitations, deadlock, and race conditions</li>
<li>the pure task farm model, its map/reduce cousin, and their limitations</li>
<li>the actors model (processes with their own state communicating only through messages, as in MPI)</li>
</ol>
<p>It's too much (each point should be an hour-long lecture in its own right, rather than 10-12 minutes of a larger lecture); what do we cut, and what's in there that doesn't need to be?</p>
