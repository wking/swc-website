<p><a href="http://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/gaudecker/">Hans-Martin von Gaudecker</a> is planning to teach a Software Carpentry-style course for economists at Universit&auml;t Mannheim this autumn &mdash; as <a href="http://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/gaudecker/teaching.html">his announcement</a> says, "I think it is amazing that a profession obsessed with efficiency affords a very obvious inefficiency: Most researchers nowadays spend a fair share of their time programming, but hardly anyone has been taught to do that well." I'll post updates here as he sends them.</p>
