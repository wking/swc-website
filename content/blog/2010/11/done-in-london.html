<p>We wrapped up this week's class in London today: I think a lot of the students felt that they'd been in the wind tunnel most of the week, but the feedback was fairly positive:</p>
<p><em><strong>Good</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>new content (hadn't seen before)</li>
<li>covered a lot (good to see things)</li>
<li>easy to apply / pragmatic</li>
<li>group exercises were fun / useful</li>
<li>Subversion</li>
<li>entertaining instructor (blah blah blah)</li>
<li>better understanding of best practices</li>
<li>persuasive arguments for best practices</li>
<li>nice to meet everybody!</li>
<li>accidental knowledge transfer (vertically and sideways)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Bad</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>too much too fast (got lost on Tuesday)</li>
<li>spent time thinking about programming tasks while instructor was showing solution</li>
<li>covered a lot (would have liked warmup before arrival)</li>
<li>too much hummus (could have used more variety in food)</li>
<li>not enough networking</li>
<li>how does it run on my machine??</li>
<li>not enough connection with sound</li>
<li>introduced software we may never use</li>
<li>not long enough (need more time)</li>
<li>no incentive to do exercises / homework</li>
</ul>
