<p>Titus Brown has posted <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jun-10/ngs-course-postmortem.html">a summary of his course</a> on next-generation sequencing data analysis for biologists with little or no previous training in computing. It went very well, and he's already trying to figure out how to do it again next year. If you can help, please give him a shout!</p>
<p><em>Later: Titus and his students used Amazon's web services in the course, which earned them <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/06/big-data-workshop-and-ec2.html">a post on Amazon's blog</a>.</em></p>
