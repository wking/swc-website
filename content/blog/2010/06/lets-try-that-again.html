<p>Thanks to everyone for their feedback on our <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2010/06/is-live-coding-worth-it.html">first attempt</a> at a lecture on regular expressions.  Our second attempt [no longer online] is now up for your viewing pleasure: it's about ten minutes long, and uses data scrubbing to motivate the use of REs.  As always, we'd be grateful for suggestions.</p>
