Title: Three More Episodes on Spreadsheets
Tags: content, versions/version-4

<p>We have uploaded episodes 5, 6, and 7 of Jason Montojo's lecture on spreadsheets, which cover <a href="/4_0/spreadsheets/conditionals.html">conditionals</a>, <a href="/4_0/spreadsheets/pivot.html">pivot tables</a>, and the basics of <a href="/4_0/spreadsheets/charting.html">charting</a>. Comments would be very welcome&mdash;and if you'd like to contribute material as well, please get in touch (we're particularly looking for help with data visualization).</p>
