Title: Program Design: the Second Instalment
Tags: lectures, versions/version-4

<p>Having recorded and posted <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2010/05/program-design-the-first-third.html">four episodes</a> of a lecture on program design yesterday, I've managed another two today (highlighted below):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/4_0/invperc/intro.html">Introduction</a></li>
<li><a href="/4_0/invperc/grid.html">The Grid</a></li>
<li><a href="/4_0/invperc/aliasing.html">Aliasing</a></li>
<li><a href="/4_0/invperc/random.html">Randomness</a></li>
<li><em><strong><a href="/4_0/invperc/neighbors.html">Finding Neighbors</a></strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong><a href="/4_0/invperc/ties.html">Resolving Ties</a></strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The remaining episodes are much longer, and will show how to assemble the program from the pieces seen so far, how to refactor the result to make it more testable, how to test it, how to speed it up, and how to build a GUI for it.  Slides for the first two of these episodes are done; I hope to have everything up by the end of this week or early next. As always, feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
