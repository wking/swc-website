<p>We are pleased to announce that we will be running a <a href="/bootcamps/2012-07-mit.html">boot camp on July 9 and 10 in Boston</a>&mdash;please see its page for details (some of which we're still working out). We have room for 40 participants, so please register early. (And if you can, register with friends: we are finding that people get a lot more out of this training if they're learning with their labmates and other collaborators.)</p>
