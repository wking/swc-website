Title: Winter School on Reproducible Research
Tags: noticed


<p>It is a pleasure to announce that the 13th Geilo Winter School will take place January 20th-25th, 2013 at Dr. Holms Hotel, Geilo, Norway. As you can see from the attached flyer, the Winter School will give an introduction to reproducible science and modern techniques for scientific software development, a topic we hope many of you find interesting. The aim of the winter school is that participants will be able to apply the learned techniques to make their own research reproducible, and topics that will be covered include reproducible research, verification and validation, software testing, and continuous integration. More information is available on the <a href="http://www.sintef.no/eVITA/">winter school webpages</a>, and participants are also encouraged to present their own research in a poster.</p>

<p>The registration deadline is December 3rd, 2012.</p>
