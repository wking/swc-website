Title: Two More Revised Software Carpentry Lectures
Tags: lectures, versions/version-3

<p>I have revised the second shell lecture and the lecture on version control for the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course, and added the necessary glossary definitions.  As always, comments are greatly appreciated.</p>
