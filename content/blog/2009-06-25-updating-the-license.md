Title: Updating the License
Tags: lectures, versions/version-3

<p>In response to several requests, we have updated the <a href="/license.html">license</a> on the course material: the course content is now covered by the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution</a> license, while the example code is (still) covered by an open source <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT license</a>.  In plain English, this means that you can re-use course content however you want, as long as you give us credit.</p>
