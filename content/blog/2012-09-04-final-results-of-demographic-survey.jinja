<p>192 people have now responded to the demographic survey we reported <a href="|filename|2012-08-17-who-are-you.md">two weeks ago</a>. Results are shown below; I'll hold off posting breakdown by discipline until I find a better (standard) classification scheme. Long story short, you are grad students, age 25-35, 28% female, with no clear preference for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. No idea what kind of music you listen to, though, or where you stand on the crucial "cave men versus astronauts" question&mdash;we'll include those in next year's survey.</p>
