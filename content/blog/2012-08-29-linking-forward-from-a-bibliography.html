<p>This web site's <a href="{{root_path}}/about/biblio.html">Research page</a> is a bibliography of 116 papers related in some way to the practice of scientific computing. I'd like to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>what related papers I've missed, and</li>
<li>when a new related paper appears.</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems to me that I ought to be able to upload the entire bibliography into some tool, then say, "Find everything that <em>isn't</em> in this list that cites things that are, minus everything in this other list over here that I've already looked at and decided aren't relevant." Going a step further, I ought to be able to prime some kind of robot to do this check automatically every week or so, and mail me when there's a hit so that I can either read it or add it to the exclusion list.</p>
<p>But "ought" doesn't put dinner on the table. I've had a superficial look at CiteSeer, Google Scholar, and Mendeley, but what I want hasn't jumped out at me. If anyone has a pointer to a one-step solution, please post a comment.</p>
