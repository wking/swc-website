<p>My grad students and I met <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/">Victoria Stodden</a> for the first time yesterday, and had a great time talking about reproducible research, science 2.0, and most particularly the kind of legal/copyright frameworks needed to move science forward.  She has two papers up that anyone interested in the subject should read: a short one that appeared in <em><a href="http://cise.aip.org/">Computing in Science and Engineerin</a>g</em> titled <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/papers/LFRSR12012008.pdf">The Legal Framework for Reproducible Research in the Sciences:  Licensing and Copyright</a>, anda longer one due out soon called <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/papers/ERROLSI03092009.pdf">Enabling  Reproducible Research: Open Licensing For Scientific Innovation</a>. If you have thoughts on the subject, I'm sure she'd enjoy hearing from you.</p>
