<p>Steve Eddins has posted <a href="http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2009/02/03/mtest-a-unit-test-harness-for-matlab-code/">an xUnit-style testing harness for MATLAB called MTEST</a> on the MATLAB Central File Exchange.  It's a nice piece of work, and I hope numerical programmers will make heavy use of it.</p>
