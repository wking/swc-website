Title: Software Carpentry's new home
Tags: sponsors/enthought, versions/version-3

<p>Thanks to the folks at <a href="http://www.enthought.com">Enthought</a>, the <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> course notes have a new home at <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org">http://www.swc.scipy.org</a>.  I'll move the wiki, bug tracker, and mailing lists there over the next couple of days as well.  I hope the community will find the material useful &mdash; it's certainly been a lot of fun putting it together.</p>
