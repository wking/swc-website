Title: Day 10: Closed Captioning
Tags: lectures, versions/version-4

<p>Our latest screencast, on NULL values in SQL, is now online. [Original link no longer active; <a href="/4_0/databases/null.html">more recent screencast on NULL values</a>.] Unlike its predecessors, this one has closed captions (as well as a transcript in the enclosing page). Please let us know what you think: are the captions helpful, or do you find them distracting?</p>
