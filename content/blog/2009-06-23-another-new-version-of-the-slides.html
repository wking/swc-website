<p>A new(er) version of the slides has been posted at http://software-carpentry.org that includes styling changes courtesy of <a href="http://www.ryanfeeley.com">Ryan Feeley</a>. There are still many minor formatting glitches; we'll fix them in the coming week, and post a schedule showing which lectures are going to be given when.</p>
<p>We've also updated the Guest Speakers page with bios and abstracts for the people who'll be talking at the <a href="http://www.marsdd.com">MaRS Centre</a> in Toronto on July 29.  Talks will run 1-6 pm, and will be followed by a wine and cheese.  The event is free, but will require advance registration&mdash;we'll post details here as soon as we have them.</p>
<p><em>Note: the guest speakers page has been retired.</em></p>
