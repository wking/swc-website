<p>Damian Rouson is teaching a class in Berkeley March 26-28, 2012, and again April 10-12, on <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/users/training/nersc-training-events/oop-fortran/">object-oriented programming in Fortran 2003</a>. The March class is full, but there are still seats available for April. Fortran is still the workhorse of scientific computing, and recent dialects like 2003 have a lot of powerful features&mdash;it's well worth checking out.</p>
