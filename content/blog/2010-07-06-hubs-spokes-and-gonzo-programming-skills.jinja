<p>In the aftermath of his (very successful) <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jun-10/ngs-course-postmortem">course on next-generation sequencing</a>, Titus Brown has posted some thoughts on <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jul-10/swc-hub-spokes.html">how to tie that material to Software Carpentry</a>. To make a short story even shorter, he thinks Software Carpentry requires more knowledge on entry than most biologists have, and proposes a hub-and-spoke model as a solution.  He also thinks we need a "Greg gets hit by a bus" plan. Please head over to <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jul-10/swc-hub-spokes.html">his post</a> and add comments there: April 2011 (the end date for the current round of funding) seems a long way off, but it isn't.</p>
