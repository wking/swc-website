<li>OpenWetware has posted <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/08/11/notes-from-scifoo">notes from SciFoo</a>. I'm sorry I missed it; looking forward to "<a href="http://www.science21stcentury.org/">Science in the 21st Century</a>" even more than before.</li>
<li>Those notes pointed me at the <a href="http://egy.org/declaration.php">Electronic Geophysical Year</a> declaration. I agree in principle, but think that something like the Open Source Initiative's "certified open" <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1677.html">badge</a> would be more useful than UN-ish statements like, "Effort should be made to identify and rescue critical Earth system data and ensure persistent access to them."</li>
<li>We're very close to re-launching the <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> site as a wiki, and I'm wondering if I should move the science-and-computing thread out of this blog into a separate one at that site.  Thoughts?</li>
