<p><a href="http://www.elangocheran.com/blog/">Elango Cheran</a> has recorded an episodes for the <a href="/4_0/setdict/">sets &amp; dictionaries</a> lecture on <a href="/4_0/setdict/phylogen.html">reconstructing phylogenetic trees</a>. It's a neat application of dictionaries to a problem that's usually explained as a matrix. Please check it out and let us know what you think.</p>
