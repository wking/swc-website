Title: 1731 People
Tags: community, content, research

<p>1731 people have completed our survey of how scientists use computers since it went online three weeks ago.  That's pretty cool, but I'd like to double the number (at least).  If you consider yourself a working scientist, and haven't taken the survey yet, please take a moment and do so.  If you aren't a scientist, but know some, please pass on the link:<br />
