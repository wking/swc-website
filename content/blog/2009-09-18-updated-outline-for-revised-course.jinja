<p>I have updated the description [no longer online] of how I plan/hope to reorganize the course.  My thanks to everyone who commented on the earlier draft; I'd be very grateful for feedback on this one as well&mdash;I realize that some of the lectures are still hopelessly ambitious, but I hope it's at least a target to shoot at.</p>
