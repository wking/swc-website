<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law">Zipf's Law</a> says that frequency is inversely proportional to rank, i.e., the second most common word in a large body of text will occur half as many times as the most common.  I have observed an even steeper curve for <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> feedback: of the 336 corrections I've received, 212 are from one person (<a href="http://www.ninjatactics.com">Adam Goucher</a>), 21 from <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/~mmoelter/">Matthew Moelter</a>, 12 from the next two people, and then we're down into the curve's long tail.  Has anyone ever done similar stats on the volume or frequency of contributions to software projects?</p>
