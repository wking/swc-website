<p>Cameron Neylon has another good post up, this one on <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/04/02/open-data-open-source-open-process-open-research/">open data, open source, and open process</a>. Like many advocates of open science, he feels he has to choose between using open source software on one hand, and getting more science done on the other.  I sympathize, especially since my colleagues and I have to choose what to use and not use in the July 2009 run of the Software Carpentry course.</p>
