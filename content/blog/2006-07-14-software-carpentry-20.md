Title: Software Carpentry 3.0
Tags: lectures, versions/version-3

<p>I am pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry 3.0</a> (Final).  The <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">web site</a> is up, the mailing lists have been populated, all the tickets have been moved into the project's Trac, and I've submitted a proposal for a wrap-up talk to <a href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2006">SciPy'06</a>. It's taken 18 months to complete instead of the 10 I originally planned, but I have a green light to teach the course again this winter at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, and hope that others will pick the course up elsewhere.</p>
