<p>We talked of the education of children; and I asked him what he thought  was the best way to teach them first. Johnson: "Sir, it is no matter  what you teach them first, any more than what leg you shall put into  your breeches first. Sir, you may stand disputing which is best to put  in first, but in the mean time your breech is bare. Sir, while you are  considering which of two things you should teach your child first,  another boy has learnt them both."</p>
