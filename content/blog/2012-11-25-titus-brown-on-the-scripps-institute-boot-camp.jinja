<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="|filename|2012-11-24-cait-pickens-on-the-scripps-institute-boot-camp.jinja">Cait Pickens' posts</a> about our workshop at the Scripps Institute comes <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2012-scripps-swc-postmortem.html">this post-mortem</a> from Titus Brown. Again, there's lots of good analysis, and many useful recommendations&mdash;particularly concerning installation and setup headaches (which continue to be our second-biggest problem).</p>
