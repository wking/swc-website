Title: Where This Course Came From
Tags: content

<p>I have created an Amazon.com Listmania list [no longer online] for the books that most directly influenced this course.  Some topics aren't directly represented&mdash;there's nothing devoted to handling XML or binary data, for example, or on big-Oh complexity or web programming&mdash;but I hope what's there will be of use.</p>
