<p>Starting next week, we're going to start posting interviews with the people who are sponsoring Software Carpentry. Questions we'll ask include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What sort of work does your organization do?</li>
<li>What kind of people work there? What backgrounds and skills do they typically have when they join you, and where do they need help?</li>
<li>What do they find most frustrating when doing computational work?</li>
<li>How do you hope this course will help them?</li>
<li>How will you tell if it actually has (i.e., how will you evaluate this course's success or failure)?</li>
</ul>
<p>What else would you like us to ask them?</p>
