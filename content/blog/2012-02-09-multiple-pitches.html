<p>Based on the feedback we've had on my first attempt [no longer online] at "Software Carpentry in 90 Seconds", it seems as though we should actually create three videos:</p>
<ol>
<li>one aimed at potential participants, i.e., students, workshop organizers, and content creators (since we're hoping these will largely be the same people);</li>
<li>one for potential sponsors, who are both funding bodies and the senior scientists who set strategic direction for departments and disciplines; and</li>
<li>some "talking head" testimonials from former participants.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this sound like the right breakdown?</p>
