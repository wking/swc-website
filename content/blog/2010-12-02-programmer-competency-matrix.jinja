<p>There's no scientific research behind <a href="http://www.starling-software.com/employment/programmer-competency-matrix.html">this tabulation</a> of what programmers ought to know, and some of the categorizations are unactionably vague, but it's still a useful guide. Most of Software Carpentry is Level 1, with some Level 0 and Level 2 stuff blended in.</p>
