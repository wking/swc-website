Title: Day 7: Mini-screencasts
Tags: content, versions/version-4

<p>Yesterday Jason and Greg experimented with breaking apart a 10 minute screencast on database grouping and aggregation into even more bite-sized pieces.  We have two flavours today: <del>point form notes with links to the screencasts</del>, or <del>point form notes with screencasts embedded</del>. [Links no longer active, <a href="/4_0/access/aggregation.html">latest screencast on database aggregation</a> as of January 2012.]</p>
<p>Feedback on this format would be really helpful.  Are these chunks <em>too</em> small?   Do you prefer embedding over linking, or vice versa?  Also, we'd welcome any comments on the material itself, of course.</p>
