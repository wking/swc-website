Title: Updating to HTML 5
Tags: content

<p>We are looking for a volunteer to update our episodes on HTML to the new HTML 5 standard.  The changes are (probably) fairly minor, and as always, we'll help with post-production (editing of audio, etc.).  If you're interested, please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">get in touch</a>.</p>
