<p>The bad news is, <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/08/retractions_rising.html">retractions of scientific papers have risen tenfold</a> since 1990. The good news is, the rate has gone from 0.0007% to 0.007%. Going back to bad news, though, some estimates of how many papers <em>ought</em> to be retracted are around 1%, so we still have a long way to go.</p>
