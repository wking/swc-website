<p>From a reader, a link to <a href="http://www.red-r.org/">Red-R</a>, a visual programming environment for R. The six-minute screencast on the <a href="http://www.red-r.org/documentation">documentation page</a> shows what it's capable of. I don't know of any similar projects for Python&mdash;I'd appreciate pointers.</p>
