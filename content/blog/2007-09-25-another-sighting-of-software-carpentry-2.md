Title: Another Sighting of Software Carpentry
Tags: venues/bernstein-berlin, versions/version-3

<p><a href="http://www.cognition.tu-berlin.de/menue/members/tiziano_zito/">Tiziano Zito</a> is teaching <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> in Berlin.  I admit I'm biased, but I think that's pretty cool ;-)  Traffic on the site is holding steady as well &mdash; wish I had time to go back and update the notes...</p>
