Title: Toronto Boot Camp February 2012: How We Did
Tags: evaluation, venues/university-of-toronto, versions/version-5-0

<p>Last week's <a href="/bootcamps/2012-02-toronto.html">boot camp</a> at the University of Toronto was not the most successful one we've ever done: quite a few registrants didn't show up, and based on <a href="http://penandpants.com/2012/02/27/teaching-python-at-software-carpentry-toronto-february-2012/">feedback from</a> <a href="http://blog.vrplumber.com/index.php?/archives/2561-First-Lessons-in-Programming,-Software-Carpentry-Review.html">the instructors</a>, we tried to cover too much, too fast. That said, the learners who stuck with us all the way through to Friday afternoon came away knowing a lot of useful things (or at least knowing that those things existed). We'll gear back a bit for next week's workshop at Indiana U. and see how that goes.</p>
