<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Audrey Watters</a> is a prolific, insightful writer on all things related to technology and education. I recently asked her to take a look at this course, and tell us what sorts of things might be worth trying. Her <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/02/09/science-software-carpentry-and-the-discipline-to-hack/">first post on the subject</a> asks some questions about educating end-user programmers in general; your thoughts would be welcome too.</p>
