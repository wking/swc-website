<p>I'm slightly obsessed with reading lists. (I even maintain a list of <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/articles/not-on-the-shelves-2009.pdf">books that haven't been written yet</a>, in the hope that it will inspire people to turn some of the entries from fantasy into reality.) Partly to give credit to all the people whose work inspired Software Carpentry, and partly to guide students who want to learn more than we can fit into a double dozen lectures, I have started a <a href="|filename|/about/biblio.html">bibliography</a>, and added links to relevant books to the lecture descriptions in the <a href="/4_0/">course outline</a>. Pointers to other material would be very welcome; I will blog soon about areas that I feel are particularly lacking.</p>
