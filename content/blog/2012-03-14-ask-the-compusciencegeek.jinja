<p>Titus Brown recently blogged a question about<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-12/publishing-paper-pipelines.html"> how to organize the files used in a computational science pipeline</a>: by project, by paper, separately, or something else. Rather than answering that, I fastened onto a throw-away comment:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I think we need an "ask the compusciencegeek" service...</em></p></blockquote>
<p>My earlier idea of having <a href="|filename|2012-02-14-stack-underflow.md">a reserved area on Stack Overflow for novice questions</a> didn't lead anywhere, but I've enjoyed the Software Sustainability Institute's "<a href="http://asksteve.software.ac.uk/">Ask Steve</a>" column. Should we start something similar here? Or direct people at Steve, and syndicate his answers here? What questions do <em>you</em> have about using computers in your research that we could answer?</p>
