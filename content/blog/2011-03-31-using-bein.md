Tags: content, versions/version-4

<p>Many thanks to Frederick Ross for putting together a <a href="/4_0/data/bein.html">short screencast on Bein</a>, a workflow manager and miniature laboratory information management system (LIMS) built in Python that fills the gap for the working scientist between the classical shell and big workflow managers like <a href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/">Galaxy</a> and major LIMS systems like <a href="http://www.cisd.ethz.ch/software/openBIS">OpenBIS</a>.  Please have a look and see if it could help make your computational life easier.</p>
