Title: Using a Debugger
Tags: content, versions/version-4

<p>We've just uploaded a new video showing <a href="/4_0/python/debugger.html">how to use a debugger</a> to track down a problem. Using a debugger instead of 'print' statements will save you a lot of time, and the skill transfers directly to pretty much any language. Please let us know what you think.</p>
