Title: Partial Outline of New Version of Course
Tags: versions/version-4

<p>I have put a mostly-complete draft of my ideas for a rewrite of the course online <a href="/4_0/">here</a>.  This version would start with specific problems, then backfill the tools and skills needed to solve them, but there are some big outstanding issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>There still isn't anything on the computational thinking skills that <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2009/08/the-big-picture.html">Jon Udell</a> identified.  I don't know how to tackle these without relying more than I want to on closed-source offerings like Yahoo! Pipes that could disappear at a moment's notice.</li>
<li>I just can't see how to fit some topics&mdash;particularly object-oriented programming and web programming&mdash;into the available space (a maximum of two hours of lecture and four hours of lab for each). What are the minimum useful problem/lecture for each?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few others as well (just search for 'TODO'), but those are the big ones.  Any help you can give would be very welcome.</p>
