<p>It took a lot longer to put together than I expected, but I'm pleased with the result&mdash;the <a href="{{root_path}}/4_0/vc/intro.html">newest screencast</a> explains what version control is, and why you'd want to use it, in four minutes and four seconds, including a wolf howl and a maniacal laugh. I hope you like it...</p>
<p>And in case you haven't been reading <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2010/07/five-five-five-scripts-in-one.html#comments">comments</a>, I'd be <em>very</em> happy to include a parallel version control lecture based on a distributed version control system like <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> or <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> if someone would like to create it.  Software Carpentry is an open  source project&mdash;if that's the itch you want to scratch, then please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">email me</a> and we'll figure out how to make it happen.</p>
