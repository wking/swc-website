<p>I had a chance to give a quick pitch for Software Carpentry yesterday, which I've since recorded and posted to our web site. I hope it's a useful overview of what we're trying to do and why; I'd be very grateful for ideas about improving it.</p>
<p><em>Note: a newer version of the pitch, titled "Software Carpentry in Ninety Seconds", is now available.</em></p>
