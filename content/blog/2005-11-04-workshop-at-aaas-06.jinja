<p>As I've mentioned before, I'm running a workshop on <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/02_PE/PE_06_Career_Workshops.shtml#EssentialSoftware">"Essential Software Skills for Research Scientists"</a> at the <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/">Annual Meeting</a> of the <a href="http://www.aaas.org">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> on Friday, February 17, in St Louis.  I'm hoping to use the workshop to convince scientists, administrators, and policy makers that the things covered in the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course are essential to good science.  If you know someone who  ought to attend, please let them know, or pass them my contact information.</p>
