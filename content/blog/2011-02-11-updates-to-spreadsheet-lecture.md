Title: Updates to Spreadsheet Lecture
Tags: content, versions/version-4

<p>We have just posted updates to the first seven episodes of the <a href="/4_0/spreadsheets/index.html">lecture on spreadsheets</a>: the new version uses Excel 2010, and the screencasts are larger to make things easier to see.  Please let us know what you think.</p>
