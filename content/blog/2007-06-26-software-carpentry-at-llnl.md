<p><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/">Titus Brown</a> has posted about the first run of his <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jun-07/llnl-course-done.html">Advanced Software Carpentry</a> course at <a href="http://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>.  It was a bit bumpy, but seems to have gone well overall, and he has put a <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/advanced-swc/">ton of useful material</a> on the web.</p>
