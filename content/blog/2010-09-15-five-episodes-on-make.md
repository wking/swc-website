Title: Five Episodes on Make
Tags: lectures, versions/version-4

<p>The <a href="{{root_path}}/4_0/make/">first five episodes of the lecture on Make</a> have been recorded, edited, and posted. I still need to do one on using Make to track data provenance, but as I discovered when I started to write it, there are a few other topics I need to fill in first.  I will do an episode on managing C/C++ compilation with Make first (probably after I return from teaching in Colorado next week).  As always, comments are welcome.</p>
