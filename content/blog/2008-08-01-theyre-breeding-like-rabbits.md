Title: They're Breeding Like Rabbits
Tags: opinion

<p>Cameron Neylon complains about <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/08/01/facebooks-for-scientists-theyre-breeding-like-rabbits/">the proliferation of networking sites, aggregators, and what-not for scientists</a>. I think he's right: none of them will succeed until there's massive consolidation.  Maybe <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> or someone like that could offer a cheap-but-not-free service customized to scientists' need on top of its existing infrastructure?</p>
