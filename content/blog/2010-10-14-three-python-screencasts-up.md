Tags: content, versions/version-4

<p>Three Python screencasts narrated by Dominique Vuvan, an alumnus of the Summer 2009 run of the course, are now online: <a href="/4_0/python/intro.html">introduction</a> (episode 1), <a href="/4_0/python/lists.html">lists</a> (4), and <a href="/4_0/python/strings.html">strings</a> (6). We'll be recording and filling in the other episodes just as soon as construction in the office slows down...</p>
