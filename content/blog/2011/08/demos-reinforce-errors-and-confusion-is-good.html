<p>Mark Guzdial has posted a good summary of <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/eric-mazurs-keynote-at-icer-2011-observing-demos-hurts-learning-and-confusion-is-a-sign-of-understanding/">this year's ICER keynote</a> by physics education guru Eric Mazur, in which he reported the results of several recent experiments. The most important for us are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Giving people a demo of something actually results in them understanding it <em>less</em> well, because they fit what they've seen into their preconceptions (which are then reinforced). Guzdial interprets this to mean that CS educators need to do more live coding.</li>
<li>Students like teachers who clarify things, but students who are confused are actually more likely to learn and understand.</li>
<li>Students' self-reported understanding of a topic has no relation to their actual understanding of it (which highlights once again the fact that self-assessment is useless).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are obvious implications for this course...</p>
