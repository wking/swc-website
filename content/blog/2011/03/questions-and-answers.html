<p>A first cut of a <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2011/03/twenty-questions-minus-two.html">question-and-answer matrix</a> for this course is now up for viewing.  It doesn't include everything, and the answers aren't particularly helpful without a second matrix showing how they connect to specific lecture topics and big principles, but I hope it's a start. Please give feedback as comments on this post; we'll add more Q's and A's in the coming days.</p>
