<p>Are you a computational scientist (but not a computer scientist) who develops scientific software? That is, do you use mathematical models to describe scientific processes and then implement these models in your software?</p>
<p>Is your main reason for software development to advance science?</p>
<p>Is your software used by a wider community of scientists (and maybe not only scientists)?</p>
<p>Would you be willing to spare about one hour of your time to participate in a PhD study?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to all the above questions, please email <a href="mailto:a.n.pawlik@open.ac.uk">Aleksandra Pawlik</a>, a PhD student from the Open University whose research focuses on software development practices of computational scientists.</p>
<p>Your participation will only involve being interviewed for approximately one hour at a time suitable for you. The study is completely anonymous.</p>
