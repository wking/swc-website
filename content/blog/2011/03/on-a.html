<p>Since money hasn't materialized for another year of full-time work on this course, I'm now looking for a job.  <a href="http://third-bit.com/blog/cv">My CV</a> is up to date, and my interview shoes are polished, so if you know of  anything meaningful and interesting in downtown Toronto [1], please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">give us a shout</a>. I'd obviously prefer something related to scientific computing, Python, and/or education, but wherever I wind up, Software Carpentry will keep going.  As always, if you'd like to help with that, please get in touch.</p>
<p>[1] After all the work we've done on this house in the last two and a half years, if I suggest relocating to my wife, I'll be doing it as a single man :-)</p>
