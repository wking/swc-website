<p>In a recent article about computational thinking, Carnegie-Mellon's Jeannette Wing says:</p>
<blockquote><p>...every scientific directorate and office at the National Science  Foundation participates in the Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation,  or CDI, program, an initiative started four years ago with a fiscal year  2011 budget request of $100 million. CDI is in a nutshell "computational thinking for science and engineering."</p></blockquote>
<p>0.1% of that would keep Software Carpentry going for another year...  Or if I'm allowed to be a curmudgeon for a moment, hands up those people who believe that $100 million is going to do 1000 times more for science and engineering than another year of work on these materials? *sigh*</p>
