<p>Today (Thursday) was the second-to-last of the course. It's been a long haul, but we hope a rewarding one. In the morning, the students had an hour-long overview of results from empirical studies of real-world software engineering; in the afternoon, we looked at how traditional and agile development processes are responses to those facts. Tomorrow morning, we'll spend an hour talking about what's gone right and what's gone wrong, then head out for a farewell lunch.</p>
<p>And in late-breaking news, one of the students, Mark Tovey, has started a blog on <a href="http://opensourcecognitivescience.wordpress.com/">open source cognitive science</a>. Thinking about it now, we should have required all of the students to start and maintain blogs during the course; here's hoping some will do it now of their own accord (hint, hint).</p>
