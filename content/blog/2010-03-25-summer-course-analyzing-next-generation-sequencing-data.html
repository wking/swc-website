<p>Analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing Data</p>
<p>May 31 &mdash; June 11th, 2010<br />
<a href="http://www.kbs.msu.edu/">Kellogg Biological Station</a>, Michigan State University<br />
CSE 891 s431 / MMG 890 s433, 2 cr</p>
<p><a href="http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2010">http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2010</a></p>
<p>Applications are due by midnight EST, April 9th, 2010.</p>
<p>Course sponsor: Gene Expression in Disease and Development Focus Group at Michigan State University.</p>
<p>Instructors: Dr. C. Titus Brown and Dr. Gregory V. Wilson</p>
<p>This intensive two week summer course will introduce students with a strong biology background to the practice of analyzing short-read sequencing data from the Illumina GA2 and other next-gen platforms. The first week will introduce students to computational thinking and large-scale data analysis on UNIX platforms. The second week will focus on mapping, assembly, and analysis of short-read data for resequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNAseq.</p>
<p>No prior programming experience is required, although familiarity with some programming concepts is suggested, and bravery in the face of the unknown is necessary. 2 years or more of graduate school in a biological science is strongly suggested.</p>
