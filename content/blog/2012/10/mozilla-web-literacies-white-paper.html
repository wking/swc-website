<p>The Mozilla Foundation (which has been our home for the last eight months) have posted a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteraciesWhitePaper">white paper on web literacies</a> that outlines their vision for the web:</p>
<blockquote>...the world's largest public resource, the operating system of the future, and (we believe) one of the greatest drivers of happiness and human flourishing the world has ever seen.</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteraciesWhitePaper#Web_Skills_.2F_Competencies_.2F_Literacies_grid">skills/competencies/literacies grid</a> gives a condensed overview of how beginners and intermediates could explore, create, connect, and protect with and on the web. Over the coming months, we'll be working to find ways of connecting this with scientists. If you'd like to help, please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">get in touch</a>.</p>
