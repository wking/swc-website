<p>Earlier this week, a Google search turned up <a href="http://www.ichec.ie/news/1346777582">a Software Carpentry workshop at the ICHEC in Dublin</a>&mdash;which was surprising, because we didn't know they were running one. It turns out they'd reinvented the term independently, though their "carpentry" was a lot more advanced than ours&mdash;according to ICHEC's Simon Wong:</p>
<blockquote><p>Half of the workshop was on software development concept and techniques but specifically aimed at deployment on the cloud, e.g. test-driven development, code management, SQL vs NoSQL databases. The rest of the workshop was more getting the attendees familiarised with various Amazon Web Services (e.g. Elastic MapReduce)</p></blockquote>
<p>They're planning more workshops of the same kind, and we're hoping to mount one of ours their in the near future as well.</p>
