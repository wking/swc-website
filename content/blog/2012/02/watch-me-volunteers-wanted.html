<p>Back in 2007, Jon Udell observed that screencasts facilitate <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/08/13/transmission-of-tacit-knowledge-teaching-what-we-dont-know-that-we-know/">accidental knowledge transfer</a> in a way that more traditional media don't. As I said <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2012/02/new-kinds-of-content.html">yesterday</a>, we'd therefore like to start recording short screencasts of programmers thinking aloud as they solve small problems using their preferred tools. The aim is to show learners <em>how</em> to program&mdash;what order to write things in, how to debug, when and how much to test, and so on. Everything will be covered by the same Creative Commons license as our other material, and made freely available for remixing and other use.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help, please:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Volunteer to be recorded</em> by <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">mailing us</a>. We'll help you install a screen recorder (if you don't have one already&mdash;you might be surprised to find that you do), give you a small problem, and edit the video you produce so that you don't have to.</li>
<li><em>Volunteer to edit video for us</em>, so that we can put our energy into organizing people :-).</li>
<li><em>Volunteer to work the floor at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/">PyCon</a> in March</em>. We can't attend (workshops to run, etc.), but it would be great if we could get a dozen or more "here's how I do it" recordings done during the conference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, as an open source project, Software Carpentry depends on <em>your</em> help to survive and thrive. If you have wanted to help, but have worried that creating and recording lectures would be too much work, this is a way for you to help that will take half an hour or less. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
