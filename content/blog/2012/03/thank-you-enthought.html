<p>We are pleased to announce that Enthought has generously given us a grant to support some of the travel costs associated with our boot camps. Along with hosting an earlier version of our material for several years and preparing a rock-solid <a href="http://enthought.com/products/epd.php">Python distribution for scientific computing</a>, this is one more good deed we'd like to thank them for.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Enthought, Inc is delighted to provide funding to Software Carpentry to support educating scientists in basic computing skills.  Enthought was founded with a mission to improve the way scientific computing is accomplished, which we do through our support of open source initiatives, applications we build for customers, and through a goal we share with Software Carpentry: teaching scientists computing skills that improve their productivity and advances their contributions to science.</em></p></blockquote>
