We're going to start using GitHub to manage our content, and as a corollary of that, we're going to use its <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues?state=open">issue tracker</a> to manage the things we're working on. I've already put a handful of medium-to-large items in it; suggestions would be welcome, particularly if accompanied by, "...and I'll do the work." :-)
