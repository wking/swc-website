<p><a href="http://www.hpcwire.com">HPCWire</a> recently <a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc/771596.html">interviewed me</a> about the <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> course.  Coincidentally, I've started getting patches from new contributors (especially Ralph Corderoy, who did a very thorough review of the shell programming lectures).  More would be welcome...</p>
