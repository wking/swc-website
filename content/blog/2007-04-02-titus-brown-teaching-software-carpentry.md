Tags: venues/llnl, lectures, versions/version-3

<p><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/">Titus Brown</a> will be teaching "<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/apr-07/class-blurb.html">Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry with Python</a>" at <a href="http://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> this spring, and is open to teaching it elsewhere after that.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/?author=1364">Chris Lasher</a> has put together some more debugging material for the course.  As <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/866.html">mentioned previously</a>, they're planning to run a writing spree at <a href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2007">SciPy'07</a>; hope to see lots of people there.</p>
