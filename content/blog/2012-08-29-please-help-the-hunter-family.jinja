<p>We are very sad to report that John Hunter, the principal author of the widely-used Python plotting package <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a>, is losing his battle with cancer. If you would like to help his family in this difficult time, please see <a href="https://plus.google.com/104831275312843762750/posts/ijGUG79JeT3">Stefan van der Walt's post</a>, or make a donation to the <a href="http://numfocus.org/johnhunter/">memorial fund</a> set up to help with his children's education.</p>
