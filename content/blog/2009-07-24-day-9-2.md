<p>I meant to write this post yesterday, but we're watching <em>Torchwood: Children of Earth</em>, and, well, you know how it goes.  We spent two sessions looking at the basics of SQL and relational databases, which almost every scientist is going to encounter at some point in their career. The morning exercises were obviously too easy&mdash;students completed them in a little over and hour&mdash;but the afternoon seemed to go at the right pace. This morning we're going to look at <a href="{{root_path}}/3_0/xml.html">XML</a>, and this afternoon at text processing with <a href="{{root_path}}/3_0/re.html">regular expressions</a>.</p>
