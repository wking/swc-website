Title: Software Carpentry Meetup at PyCon
Tags: community

<p>I'm not able to be at PyCon this year, but if Software Carpentry fans would like to get together, Shreyas Cholia is organizing a lunchtime meetup on Friday.  Please <a href="mailto:scholia@lbl.gov">drop him a line</a> if you'd like to connect.</p>
