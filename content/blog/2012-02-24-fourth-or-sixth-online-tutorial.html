<p>For the past four weeks, I've been meeting online with learners from the<a href="http://www.stsci.edu"> Space Telescope Science Institute</a> to work through some Python topics and exercises. (We split the group in two for a couple of those sessions to accommodate different interests and levels.) I think it's been going pretty well: about half the people who took part in the two-day workshop in January are still with us, and we've just covered basic image processing with PIL. I'm looking forward to finding out whether the model scales to more groups with more people in the coming four months.</p>
