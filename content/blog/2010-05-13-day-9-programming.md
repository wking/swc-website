Title: Day 9: Programming
Tags: lectures, versions/version-4

<p>Our first screencast showing <del>a bit of Python programming</del> is now up for comments. [Link no longer active, more recent link to <a href="/4_0/setdict/dict.html">screencast on dictionaries</a>.]  It's deliberately low-tech: we used Emacs as an editor, and simply showed the program's textual output instead of stepping through it with a debugger. (Our next programming lectures will be IDE-based for comparison.) Please tell us what you think about the pace, watchability, etc.</p>
