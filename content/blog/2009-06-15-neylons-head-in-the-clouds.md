Title: Neylon's Head in the Clouds
Tags: noticed

<p>Cameron Neylon (a guest speaker at this summer's offering of the course) is putting together a paper for the new BMC journal <a href="http://www.aejournal.net/"><em>Automated Experimentation</em></a> titled <a href="http://cameronneylon.wikidot.com/head-in-the-clouds-automated-experimentation">"Head in the Clouds: Re-imagining the experimental laboratory record for the web-based networked world</a>". It's an excellent description of what a web-native lab notebook could/should look like, and much more besides.</p>
