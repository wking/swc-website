<p>If you asked to enrol in the Winter 2011 run of the course, you should have received an email request from us on Wednesday pointing you at a form we'd like you to fill in, and another message today clarifying one of the questions.  You should also then have received a message saying, "Some people are reporting that they only got #2 of the above, presumably because their spam filters ate #1, so please check."  If you didn't get Wednesday's message, or this morning's repeat, please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">contact us</a> directly and we'll sort it out.</p>
