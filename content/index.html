    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry helps researchers be more productive
      by teaching them basic computing skills.
      We run boot camps at dozens of sites around the world,
      and also provide open access material online for self-paced instruction.
      The benefits are more reliable results and higher productivity:
      a day a week is common, and a ten-fold improvement isn't rare.
    </p>

    <h4>Boot Camps</h4>
    <p>
      Our boot camps cover the core skills every scientist needs to get
      more done in less time: program construction, version control,
      testing, the command line, and data management. Short lessons
      alternate with hands-on practical sessions for two full days.
